		    <h1>The Rule of Maximum Practical Formality</h1>

            <p>At each step of a development, use descriptions that are as =
formal as possible.</p>

            <p>
			    This has two benefits:
				</p><ol>
				    <li>Formal descriptions are more precise than informal ones, which =
forces a thorough understanding of the issues and questions.</li>
					<li>More powerful verification methods for formal descriptions exist t=
han methods for informal ones, so there is more confidence in each step=E2=
=80=99s correctness.</li>
				</ol>
			<p></p>

            <p>The rule of maximum practical formality was articulated in t=
he paper <a href=3D"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=3D9=
76937">Correctness by Construction: Developing a Commercial Secure System</=
a> (see the top of page 21 and the bottom of page 19)</p>
