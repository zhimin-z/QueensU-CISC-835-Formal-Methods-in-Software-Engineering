            <pre>               Rather than saying:
               =20
                    Would you like to pay me to do some modeling
                    and see what happens?=20
              =20
               how about asking:
              =20
                   Would you be willing to pay for some reports of=20
                   flaws in your design?=20
                  =20
               Or:=20
              =20
                   Would you like to pay me to generate ten crazy
                   scenarios you haven=E2=80=99t considered?
            </pre>
           =20
            <p>Hmm, upon reflection I don't think any manager would be inte=
rested in receiving "crazy" scenarios.</p>
           =20
            <p>These are probably better approaches:</p>
           =20
            <pre>               Would you be interested in an identificatio=
n of flaws
               in your design?
              =20
               Would it be useful to have ten use cases that illustrate
               undesirable behavior that you haven=E2=80=99t yet considered=
?
            </pre>
           =20
            <p>If you present this to a manager, you are going to have to
               convince the manager that this is not only worth doing, but
               of higher priority than other tasks on his/her plate. Also,
               you will have to give some evidence to support the claim tha=
t
               you can do what you claim. </p>
